# Quickstart Webhooks

## Requirements

Simple requirements render happy developers! The only requirements for this quickstart to run are `Docker` and `Compose`! üê≥

## Implemented endpoints

This quickstart implements two basic endpoints:

### `POST /webhook`

This endpoint receives an [Event](https://docs.fintoc.com/reference#eventos) object as the JSON request body. This is the endpoint that should be passed to Fintoc as the Webhook Endpoint. On this quickstart, the events are just being saved to a database, but you could send a push notification to a mobile application or interact with other parts of your application data. The sky is the limit!

### `GET /events`

This endpoint serves just as a validation endpoint for you to confirm that the events are being saved idempotently on the database.

## Local Usage

This quickstart doesn't need to be deployed to a remote server for the webhooks to work. Instead, it starts the server locally, and tunnels it to a public URL using `ngrok`. Let's start!

To try the application, first migrate the database inside the Docker container:

```sh
docker-compose run web flask db upgrade
```

Now, start the development server:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Because of the usage of `ngrok` to expose the local application to the internet, the last line of the `docker-compose up` command logs should look something like this:

```
ngrok_1  | t=2021-07-09T15:47:35+0000 lvl=info msg="started tunnel" obj=tunnels name=command_line addr=http://web:5000 url=https://4bc029a5ef40.ngrok.io
```

Notice how the last attribute of the log states that `url=https://4bc029a5ef40.ngrok.io` (the random string before `ngrok.io` should change every time that you start the server). This means that the running application can be found at `https://4bc029a5ef40.ngrok.io`, so you would need to create the Webhook Endpoint pointing at `https://4bc029a5ef40.ngrok.io/webhook`.

Once the server is running, go to the [Fintoc Webhooks Dashboard](https://app.fintoc.com/webhooks) and create a new test Webhook Endpoint. This Webhook Endpoint should be pointing to `https://<your-random-string>.ngrok.io/webhook` (remember that this URL will appear on your console after running `docker-compose up`). Now, you can send a test webhook to that Webhook Endpoint, and you console should log the request. Moreover, you should now be able to `GET https://<your-random-string>.ngrok.io/events`, and the test event sent on the test webhook should now be part of the returned array! üéâ

### Signature validation

This quickstart repository comes with signature validation built-in! By default, it looks for the environmental variable named `WEBHOOK_SECRET` for the secret to use for the validation (you can read more about it on the [official docs](https://docs.fintoc.com/docs/valida-webhooks)). If no environmental variable is present, the signature validation will be skipped.

The problem about signature validation on the local server, is that you need the server to be running in order to create a Webhook Endpoint (because you need to know the `ngrok` URL), which will give you the webhook secret you need to validate signatures, but in order to add that webhook secret to the environment using Docker, you would need to stop the server and re-start it, passing the new environmental variable to the container, which would change the URL that `ngrok` uses to expose the server to the world. You can see why testing this locally can be a bit of a challenge. To avoid having to deal with this stuff, you can change the line `13` of the `middleware.py` file (while the server is running, after creating the Webhook Endpoint on Fintoc) in order to make the variable named `WEBHOOK_SECRET` be assigned directly to the webhook secret, and not through an environmental variable:

```diff
- WEBHOOK_SECRET = os.environ.get("WEBHOOK_SECRET")
+ WEBHOOK_SECRET = "whsec_live_kY8cxHAHSD9WvzUf7Z7Ky-yx"
```

This will make the server hot reload, keeping the `ngrok` URL whilst being able to use the created webhook secret.

## Deployment to Heroku

You can also run this from Heroku instead of using `ngrok` and your local machine! To run from Heroku, you can follow these steps:

First, create a new Heroku app:

```sh
heroku create
```

This should show on the console the name of the newly created application. From now on, `<app-name>` should be replaced with that name.

Then, add the `heroku-postgresql` addon to the Heroku app:

```sh
heroku addons:create -a <app-name> heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```

This command will add the **free** basic `heroku-postgresql` addon to your app (you can upgrade this later if you desire).

Next, build the image and push it to Container Registry:

```sh
heroku container:push -a <app-name> web
```

Now, release the image to your app:

```sh
heroku container:release -a <app-name> web
```

Finally, run the database migrations:

```sh
heroku run -a <app-name> flask db upgrade
```

Remember to add a secret key on the Heroku environment, using the `SQLALCHEMY_SECRET_KEY` key.

You should now be able to use `https://<app-name>.herokuapp.com/webhook` as the Webhook Endpoint from the [Fintoc Webhooks Dashboard](https://app.fintoc.com/webhooks)!

### Signature validation

If you want to validate signatures on Heroku, things are a bit easier. After deploying the application to Heroku and creating the Webhook Endpoint on Fintoc, retrieve the webhook secret and add it to Heroku's environmental variables on the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` variable. Now the signatures will get validated!
